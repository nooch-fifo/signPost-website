# signPost-website
These are the PHP, Javascript, HTML, and CSS files of the full website for Sign Post NJ that was a work in progress. It was intended to be an informational website with a home page, a page displaying their work, a contact form page, and a page dedicated to their graduation signs/ about them. Most of these pages and the code for them can be found in this repository.
The website was not completed/ is not yet completed, due to their decision to keep their landing pages/single page applications up temporarily until they have more funding. 
Their single page applications, which were also made by me, can be found at https://signpostnj.com/ and https://graduation-signs.com/.
